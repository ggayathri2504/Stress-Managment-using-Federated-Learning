# Stress-Managment-using-Federated-Learning

The Flask application that has been developed is a prototype for a stress level management system. The application makes use of a stress dataset that has been collected from Kaggle as a sample. The user is required to answer a set of questions displayed on the application, and their stress level is then displayed.

The aim of this application is to provide users with a way to manage their stress levels by answering questions related to their current situation. This data can be used to find patterns and correlations to better understand how to manage stress levels.

The application uses federated learning and edge computing concepts to make it more user-friendly and productive. Wearable smart devices are integrated into the system, and edge computing plays a pivotal role in stress management. The federated learning model employed in the application keeps tabs on the user's confidential information and ensures privacy of data when it comes to training a stress predictor and follow up model.

Overall, the Flask application is a step towards creating a stress level management system that is easy to use and provides users with the tools they need to manage their stress levels effectively. By using data collected through surveys and other means, the system can provide personalized recommendations and support to users to help them cope with stress.

## Steps involved in developing an application:

  1. Data Collection: The targeted users for the stress management system are the working women faculty in reputed educational institutions. The educators would be guided to the respective website portal made for stress management. 

  2. Data Preprocessing & Interpretation: The surveys would then be filled in and submitted to the portal where a copy of the trained model would be giving some corrective suggestions to reduce the amount of stress of the user. If the educator has a wearable smart watch device, then the information from the respective device would be taken so that proper and constant follow up is maintained for the user. 

  3. On-Device Analysis with Data Privacy: It is to be noted that the survey details filled and the wearable devices readings would not be hastily taken up to the server’s main trained model for better training the model, instead only the experience retained by the copy of the training model made available to each and every user in the form of parameters and weights needed for the model functioning along would be taken to the main server. 

  4. Edge Computing: In order to follow up and understand the user’s mental wellbeing, a wearable smart device updates the stress levels of the user and gives a clear picture.

  5. Outcomes: The stress management system would thus be used by the users to ultimately get rid of the stress people face most effectively and efficiently.
